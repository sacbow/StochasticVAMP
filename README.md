This repository contains the demonstration of "Stochastic Vector Approximate Message Passing" proposed in our recent work, along with introductory notebooks on Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP) with examples in sparse linear regression and phase retrieval.

### Versions
We tested the codes with the following environment : 
Python : python 3.11.2
module : numpy 1.26.4, scipy 1.13.1, matplotlib 3.9.0, cv2 4.10.0

### Description of materials
The jupyter notebook "Stochastic_VAMP.ipynb"  performs numerical experiments on the proposed algorithm, Stochastic VAMP.
Other two notebooks are introductory demonstrations of VAMP. These notebooks call functions defined in modules included in "utils".
